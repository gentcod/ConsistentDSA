Optional created variables to help run some algorithms:
- numbers := []int {2, 6, 1, 8, 10, 4, 1}
- In the case of running alorithms that work with LinkedLists, 
   helper functions have been created to initialize a linkedlist and get the values in the linkedlist
   Refrence the /helper/helper.go file. Use this to create a linkedlist -> 
      node1 := helper.InitListNode([]int{5,6,4})

Optional quick reference for package import
- "github.com/gentcod/ConsistentDSA/Algorithms/[packageName]"

Run algorithm
- packageName.Solve(acceptedArg)
- resolve(packageName.Solve, acceptedArg)
